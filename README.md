# Edge-AI-Suites

## Overview

**Edge AI Suites** are collections of open, industry-specific AI software development kits (SDKs), microservices, and sample applications for independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators and solutions builders. 

These suites accelerate the development of custom AI solutions by offering:
•	Curated sample applications
•	Optimized code for AI, media, and end-to-end workloads
•	Benchmarks and deployment guides

## Suites and Use Cases

•	[The Metro AI Suite](metro-ai-suite) accelerates the development of solutions for Edge AI video, safety and security, smart city and transportation use cases. 

•	[The Manufacturing AI Suite](manufacturing-ai-suite) enhances output quality and volume with automated defect detection, asset tracking, software-defined controls, and other capabilities, empowering smart factories with Vision, Time Series and Generative AI capabilities. 

•	[The Media & Entertainment AI Suite](media-and-entertainment-ai-suite) provides libraries and sample applications to accelerate solution development for high-performance, high-quality, and live video production, which improves viewer experience. 

•	[The Retail AI Suite](retail-ai-suite) accelerates hardware decisions for Retail AI workloads at the edge, featuring use cases such as self-checkout and loss prevention. 


•	[The Robotics AI Suite](robotics-ai-suite) provides ready to use samples leveraging AI to help solve common robotics problems such as perception, navigation, simulation, and planning. 

•	[The Education AI Suite](education-ai-suite) is a preview collection of education-focused AI applications, libraries, and benchmarking tools to help developers build solutions faster.
