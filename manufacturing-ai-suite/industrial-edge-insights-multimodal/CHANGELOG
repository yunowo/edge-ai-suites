## [2025.2] - December 2025

### Added
- Introduced a new sample application for Multimodal (Vision + Timeseries) Weld Defect Detection, combining camera-based visual inspection and sensor data analysis for industrial edge insights. ([#669])
- Added fusion analytics module to combine vision and time-series anomaly detection results.
- Implemented weld data simulator for generating video streams (RTSP) and time-series data (MQTT).
- Added logger for fusion analytics and weld simulator for improved traceability. ([#777])
- Added step to enable copyleft source in build process. ([#776])
- Added architecture diagram for multimodal weld defect detection. ([#802])
- Enabled publishing of source timestamp from simulator for time-series data. ([#801])
- Added comprehensive Helm chart structure and deployment documentation for multimodal app. ([#813])
- Added "How to Deploy with Helm" section to documentation. ([#837])

### Changed
- Updated fusion logic default mode from "AND" to "OR" for anomaly detection, improving detection flexibility. ([#794])
- Enhanced fusion analytics with additional metadata tracking, including vision classification labels.
- Redesigned Grafana dashboard layout with new fusion analytics results table and reorganized panels.
- Renamed resource folder from "weld-porosity" to "models" and updated model path to "weld-defect-classification-f16-DeiT". ([#840])
- Updated DLStreamer pipeline server image from Ubuntu 22 to Ubuntu 24.
- Modular refactoring of time series documentation for improved maintainability. ([#899])
- Multimodal apps documentation updated to use tile layout for better navigation. ([#908])
- Fixed references and broken links in documentation and toctree. ([#934], [#820])
- Fixed and enhanced documentation for Docker and Helm deployment workflows. ([#889])
- Corrected fusion analytics MQTT topic name from "fusion/anomaly" to "fusion/anomaly_detection_results".
- Updated arch diagram to remove influxdb out line from DLS PS.
- Removed references to non-existing articles in documentation. ([#924])
- Fixed dashboard name references in documentation. ([#881])
- Updated documentation for multimodal weld defect detection, transitioning from wind turbine anomaly detection theme. ([#838])
- Improved documentation clarity and consistency across files.

### Removed
- Removed Helm chart deployment support for the industrial-edge-insights-multimodal sample application due to Kubernetes networking issues. Docker Compose deployment remains supported. ([#896])

### Security
- Addressed Trivy image scan vulnerabilities by updating Python base image version and upgrading pip in all affected Dockerfiles. ([#928])
- Added SSL configuration to nginx for secure communications. ([#851])

### Fixed
- Fixed DBS GitHub workflow by adding HOST_IP environment variable and correcting scan names. ([#916])
- Reordered CWD variable assignment in workflow scripts.
- Fixed minor documentation issues. ([#841])
- Fixed table of contents in MultiModal Weld Defect Detection documentation. ([#842])
