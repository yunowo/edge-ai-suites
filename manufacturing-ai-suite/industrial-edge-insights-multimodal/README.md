# MultiModal Weld Defect Detection Sample Application

The Weld Defect Detection sample application demonstrates a powerful fusion of vision and time series analytics to identify welding anomalies. By simultaneously analyzing camera feeds for visual defects and sensor data for abnormal patterns, the application provides a comprehensive assessment of weld quality. Fusion analytics intelligently combines insights from both modalities, applying configurable `AND` or `OR` logic to flag anomalous welds. This multi-modal approach enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enables early identification of potential issues in automated welding processes. The solution is adaptable, supporting various deployment scenarios and integration with existing manufacturing systems.
