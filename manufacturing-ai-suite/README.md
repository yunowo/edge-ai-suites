**Manufacturing AI Suite (MAS)** is a comprehensive toolkit for building, deploying, and scaling AI applications in industrial environments. Powered by Intel’s Edge AI technologies, it enables real-time integration and innovation with optimized hardware.

It includes:
•	Tools for AI acceleration (for example, MQTT/OPC UA support, analytics libraries, camera system software)
•	A complete AI pipeline for closed-loop systems
•	Benchmarking support for evaluating performance across time series, vision, and generative AI workloads

The Manufacturing AI Suite helps you develop solutions for:
•	**Production Workflow**: Detect defects, optimize efficiency
•	**Workplace Safety**: AI-driven risk reduction
•	**Real-Time Insights**: Local data processing, trend tracking
•	**Automation**: Instant alerts and corrective actions
