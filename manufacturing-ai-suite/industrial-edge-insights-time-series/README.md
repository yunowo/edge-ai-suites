# Industrial Edge Insights - Time Series Sample Application

Industrial Edge Insights - Time Series sample application demonstrates a time series use case by detecting the anomalous power generation patterns relative to wind speed. By identifying deviations, it helps optimize maintenance schedules and prevent potential turbine failures, enhancing operational efficiency.

## Get Started
