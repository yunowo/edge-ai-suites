## 2. Enabling UEFI Secure Boot for Smart Intersection

UEFI Secure Boot establishes a chain of trust from firmware to OS, cryptographically verifying the signature and hash of all boot components before passing control to the operating system. This ensures the Smart Intersection application runs on a verified, secure platform.

Ubuntu LTS official releases are signed by Canonical, and Canonical's certificate is pre-enrolled in the MOK (Machine Owner Key) database.

**Step 1: Install Required Tools**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y openssl mokutil sbsigntool
```

**Step 2: Verify Kernel Signature**

```bash
sudo sbverify --list /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel_version>-generic
```

![Kernel Signature Verification](./_images/security_kernel_signature_verification.png)**Step 3: Verify Certificate Enrollment**

```bash
mokutil --list-enrolled
```

![MOK Database Certificate List](./_images/security_mok_database_certificate_list.png)

**Step 4: Install Signed Shim Binary**

Most UEFI firmware has Microsoft keys enrolled by default. To verify GRUB and Linux kernel signed by Canonical, install the signed shim binary. Shim is a small bootloader signed by Microsoft that bridges the gap between firmware and Linux GRUB, maintaining the chain of trust.

```bash
sudo apt-get install sbsigntool openssl grub-efi-amd64-signed shim-signed
sudo grub-install --uefi-secure-boot
```

**Step 5: Configure Secure Boot**

1. Reboot the platform and enter the UEFI GUI menu
2. Verify that Secure Boot is initially disabled
3. Confirm the shim binary can boot to OS

**Step 6: Enroll Microsoft Certificates**

1. Get the Secure Boot Microsoft keys and certificates:
```bash
git clone https://git.launchpad.net/qa-regression-testing
```

2. Enroll the certificates (type 'y' when prompted):
```bash
cd qa-regression-testing/notes_testing/secure-boot
cp -rf * /tmp
sudo /tmp/sb-setup enroll microsoft
```

> **Note**: If enrollment errors occur, reboot the platform, boot using `fs0:/efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi`, and rerun the enroll command.

**Step 7: Enable and Verify Secure Boot**

1. Reboot the platform and enter the BIOS menu
2. Verify that Secure Boot is now enabled
3. Boot using `fs0:/efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi`
4. Check the Secure Boot status after booting to Ubuntu:

```bash
mokutil --sb-state
```

### TPM Clear Operation

TPM clear removes all stored keys, certificates, and ownership data from the Trusted Platform Module, resetting it to factory defaults. This is useful when setting up security for a new Smart Intersection deployment.

1. Enter the boot manager menu
2. Choose the TCG2 configuration 
3. Clear the TPM

![TPM Clear Configuration Menu](./_images/security_tpm_clear_configuration_menu.png)

## 3. Ubuntu Installation with Full Disk Encryption

Full Disk Encryption (FDE) protects Smart Intersection application data and configurations by encrypting the entire disk. This ensures that sensitive traffic analysis data and system configurations remain secure even if the hardware is compromised.

Once FDE is enabled, the encrypted disk can only be accessed with the security key configured during installation.

**Step 1: Prepare Ubuntu Installation Media**

1. Download the official Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS release from the Ubuntu website
2. Create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive
3. Enter the boot manager menu and select the bootable USB with Ubuntu 24.04.2

![Boot Manager Menu Selection](./_images/security_boot_manager_menu_selection.png)

**Step 2: Begin Ubuntu Installation**

Boot from the bootable USB and select "Try or Install Ubuntu".

**Step 3: Configure Basic Settings**

Configure language, accessibility options, keyboard layout, and other basic settings. Optionally connect to wired internet if available.

**Step 4: Select Installation Type**

Select "Install Ubuntu" option.

**Step 5: Choose Installation Mode**

Select "Interactive Installation" for full control over security settings.

**Step 6: Configure Applications**

In the Applications page, select "Default selection". If you made a wired connection earlier, select both checkboxes.

**Step 7: Enable Disk Encryption**

In the Disk setup page:
1. Select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
2. Click the "Advanced features" button to access encryption options

**Step 8: Choose Encryption Method**

There are two FDE methods available. Choose based on your Smart Intersection security requirements:

**Method 1: Software-based Encryption**
- Select **"Use LVM and encryption"**
- This encrypts your entire drive using LVM
- Requires a strong passphrase that you'll enter at boot time to decrypt and access your system

**Method 2: Hardware-backed Full Disk Encryption** 
- Uses dedicated security chips (TPM or Secure Enclave) to store encryption keys
- Provides stronger protection than software-only encryption
- **Note**: To enable this option, you must first enable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI settings and clear/reset the TPM module

![FDE Method Selection](./_images/security_fde_method_selection.png)

If Hardware-backed full disk encryption is enabled, you can skip Steps 9 and 12 as the TPM chip will automatically handle key management and drive decryption.

**TPM Recovery Key**: Use the following command to show TPM recovery keys:
```bash
sudo snap recovery --show-keys
```

![Hardware-backed Encryption Configuration](./_images/security_hardware_backed_encryption_config.png)

**Step 9: Create Security Key** (Software-based Encryption Only)

Create a **Security Key** that will be required to decrypt the Ubuntu drive before accessing the Smart Intersection application.

**Step 10: Complete Installation Configuration**

Complete the installation by configuring:
- Username and password
- Timezone settings
- Review your choices before proceeding

**Step 11: Finalize Installation**

1. Complete the installation process
2. Restart the PC when prompted
3. Remove the bootable drive when instructed after restart

**Step 12: First Boot with Encryption** (Software-based Encryption Only)

1. Enter your **Security Key** from Step 9 as the encryption password to unlock the disk
2. The Ubuntu login screen will appear
3. Ubuntu installation with FDE is now completed and ready for Smart Intersection deployment

## 4. TME (Total Memory Encryption) Enablement

Intel TME encrypts the computer's entire memory with a single transient key. All memory data passing to and from the CPU is encrypted, including sensitive Smart Intersection data such as traffic analysis algorithms, detection models, credentials, encryption keys, and other proprietary information.

![TME Security Overview](./_images/security_tme_overview.png)

**Step 1: Check TME Support**

First, verify if TME is supported on the Intel platform. Read bits 35:32 of MSR 0x981. If this value is non-zero, TME is supported.

![TME Support Check Command](./_images/security_tme_support_check_command.png)

**Step 2: Enable TME in BIOS**

1. Enter BIOS menu by pressing 'F2' while booting the platform
2. Navigate to: **Intel Advanced Menu → CPU Configuration → Total Memory Encryption**
3. Set to **Enabled**
4. Save changes (F4) and reboot

![TME BIOS Configuration Menu](./_images/security_tme_bios_configuration_menu.png)

**Step 3: Verify TME Enablement**

Check if TME is enabled by reading bit 1 of MSR 0x982. If TME is enabled, the value returned will be 1 as shown.

![TME Enablement Verification](./_images/security_tme_enablement_verification.png)

**Step 4: Alternative Verification Using Kernel Logs**

You can also use the `dmesg` kernel log to check TME enablement status:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i tme
```

## 5. Trusted Compute Smart City Intersection

The Smart Intersection is a sample application that unifies the analytics of a traffic intersection using Trusted Compute technology. Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server (DL Streamer Pipeline Server) utilizes a pre-trained object detection model to generate object detection metadata and a local NTP server for synchronized timestamps. This metadata is published to the MQTT broker. This example demonstrates the deployment of the DL Streamer Pipeline Server in a TC environment, facilitating the isolation of video analytics pipelines.

### Prerequisites

- Trusted Compute must be installed and running
- K3s (Kubernetes) installed on the system
- Helm package manager installed

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

**Install K3s if not already available:**

```bash
# Install K3s
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# Verify K3s Installation
sudo systemctl status k3s

# Wait a moment for K3s to fully start, then check nodes
sudo k3s kubectl get nodes

# Set up Kubeconfig
mkdir -p ~/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.kube/config
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
echo 'export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Install Helm:**

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod +x get_helm.sh
# Execute the script to install Helm
./get_helm.sh
# Verify the installation
helm version
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone and navigate to the Smart Intersection Helm repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git

# Navigate to the Metro AI Suite directory
cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/
```

### Step 3: Replace the Deployment YAML

Inside the `smart-intersection/chart/templates/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/` directory, replace the deployment.yaml with the YAML file provided in the trusted compute repository.

```bash
# Navigate to the templates directory
cd smart-intersection/chart/templates/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/

# Replace the deployment file with your custom version
# Copy the custom deployment.yaml to this location

# Update the WEBRTC_SIGNALING_SERVER configuration
# In configmap.yaml, change:
# WEBRTC_SIGNALING_SERVER: "ws://localhost:8443" 
# to:
# WEBRTC_SIGNALING_SERVER: "ws://<Host_IP>:8443"
# Where <Host_IP> is the Host IP of the machine where the application is running
```

### Step 4: Configure Resource Allocation

Configure resource allocation to allocate CPU cores and memory. You can adjust the resource requirements according to your specific needs by modifying the resource specifications in the deployment YAML file.

### Step 5: Deploy the Helm Chart

Follow the steps mentioned in the official documentation to run the Helm chart:

[Steps to Deploy the Helm Chart](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/smart-intersection/docs/user-guide/how-to-deploy-helm.md)

### Step 6: Verify DL Streamer Launch

**1. Verify the DL Streamer Launch in TC**

To confirm that the DL Streamer has successfully launched in the Trusted Compute environment, check if the virtual machine associated with it is running:

```bash
ps aux | grep qemu
```

If DL Streamer is running correctly, you should see a process entry for the corresponding QEMU instance. This entry typically includes:
- The command used to launch the VM
- The amount of CPU/memory it is using
- The process ID (PID) of the VM

**2. Check DL Streamer Logs**

To monitor the DL Streamer and see the total frames per second (FPS) count, postdecode timestamp, check the logs of the DL Streamer pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <dl-streamer-deployment-name> -n smart-intersection
```

This trusted compute implementation adds an additional layer of security by isolating video analytics pipelines within secure virtual machines, ensuring that sensitive traffic analysis operations are protected from potential threats.

## Summary

With these security features enabled, your Smart Intersection application will benefit from:

- **dTPM**: Hardware-based cryptographic operations and secure key storage
- **UEFI Secure Boot**: Verified boot chain ensuring system integrity 
- **Full Disk Encryption**: Protection of traffic analysis data and system configurations
