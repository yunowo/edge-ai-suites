# Visual AI Demo Kit - Tutorial 3

<!--
**Sample Description**: Learn how to create custom Grafana dashboards that integrate real-time video streams and MQTT data visualization for metro vision AI applications.
-->
This tutorial guides you through creating a custom Grafana dashboard that displays real-time object detection video streams and data analytics. You'll build an integrated monitoring solution that combines visual feeds with data tables for comprehensive metro vision monitoring.

<!--
**What You Can Do**: Highlight the developer workflows supported by the guide.
-->
By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- **Create Custom Dashboards**: Build new Grafana dashboards tailored for metro vision applications
- **Integrate Video Streams**: Embed real-time WebRTC video feeds using HTML panels
- **Visualize MQTT Data**: Create dynamic tables that display live object detection data from MQTT streams

## Prerequisites

- Verify that your metro vision AI application is running: [Setup Guide](./tutorial-1.md)
- Verify that your Node Red flow setup is completed: [Node Red Flow](./tutorial-2.md)
- Access to Grafana dashboard (typically at `https://localhost/grafana`)
- WebRTC streaming service configured and operational
- MQTT broker running with object detection data feed

## Set up and First Use

### 1. **Create a New Dashboard**

1. **Access Grafana Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost/grafana`
   - Log in with your Grafana credentials
      - Username: admin
      - Password: admin

2. **Create New Dashboard**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the left sidebar
   - Select "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu
   - Select "New Dashboard" from the top right menu
   - Click "Add Visualization"

### 2. **Add Real-Time Video Stream Panel**

1. **Create HTML Panel**:
   - In the panel editor, change the visualization type to "Text" (On Right side of Visualization Editor)
   - Switch to "HTML" mode
   - Add the following iframe code:
   - In the below code update <HOST_IP> to your host IP address. If you are testing on localhost, update it to localhost.

   ```html
   <iframe
     src="https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/object_detection_1/"
     style="width:100%;height:500px;"
     allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
     frameborder="0">
   </iframe>
   ```

2. **Configure Panel Settings**:
   - Set panel title to "Live Object Detection Feed"
   - Click "Save Dashboard" to save the panel
   - Adjust panel size as needed.

### 3. **Create MQTT Data Table**

1. **Add New Panel**:
   - Click "Add Visualization" to create another visualization
   - Select "Table" as the visualization type (On Right side of Visualization Editor)
   - Set panel title to "Real time Object Detection Data"

2. **Configure Data Source**:
   - Set your MQTT data source as "grafana-mqtt-datasource"
   - Configure topic to fetch object detection metrics
   - Update Topic to "enhanced"

3. **Add Transformations** (Optional):
   - You can add different types of transformations to this dashboard panel.

### 4. **Configure Dashboard Layout**

1. **Arrange Panels**:
   - Drag and resize panels for optimal viewing
   - Position video feed in the upper section
   - Place data table below or alongside the video

2. **Save Dashboard**:
   - Click the save icon (disk symbol)
   - Name your dashboard "Metro Vision Object Detection"
   - Add appropriate tags for organization

## Expected Results

If you are unable to visualize any data, try restarting the inference pipeline.

After completing this tutorial, you should have:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A custom Grafana dashboard displaying real-time video and data
- **Live Video Feed**: WebRTC stream showing object detection overlay
- **Dynamic Data Table**: Real-time MQTT data updates with detection information
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Combined visual and analytical view of metro vision system

## Troubleshooting

1. **Video Stream Not Loading**
   - Verify WebRTC service is running: `docker ps | grep webrtc`
   - Check WEBRTC_URL environment variable configuration
   - Ensure browser permissions allow autoplay and camera access

2. **MQTT Data Not Appearing**
   - Confirm MQTT broker connection in Grafana data sources
   - Validate MQTT topic subscription and message format
   - Check query syntax for your specific data source

3. **Dashboard Performance Issues**
   - Reduce refresh intervals if system is slow
   - Limit data query time ranges
   - Consider using data aggregation for high-volume streams
