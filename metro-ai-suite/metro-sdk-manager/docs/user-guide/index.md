## Overview

Designed for developers working with Intel's edge computing ecosystem, the SDK Manager eliminates the complexity of manually configuring SDK combinations by providing automated dependency resolution, version compatibility checking, and integrated toolchain setup. The tool supports interactive wizard-guided selection for developers to download and install the SDK directly into their development environment.

Built with developer productivity in mind, it handles cross-platform builds, maintains isolated development environments, and provides real-time compatibility validation across different SDK versions. It includes extensive documentation with code samples, API references, and troubleshooting guides. Whether you're prototyping edge AI solutions or deploying production applications, the SDK Manager ensures consistent, reproducible development environments across your team and deployment targets.
