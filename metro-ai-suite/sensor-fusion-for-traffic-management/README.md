# Intel® Metro AI Suite Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management

Unlock the future of traffic management with the Intel® software reference implementation of the Metro AI Suite Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management. This implementation integrates AI inferencing with sensor fusion technology, utilizing multi-modal sensors such as cameras and radars to deliver unparalleled performance. A traffic management system leveraging the fusion of camera and radar/lidar sensors offers superior accuracy and reliability over camera-only solutions. Cameras capture high-resolution visual data, while radar/lidar sensors precisely measure speed and distance, even under challenging conditions like fog, rain, or darkness. This integration ensures a more robust and comprehensive approach to traffic monitoring and decision-making, enhancing overall system performance and safety.
