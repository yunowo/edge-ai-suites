# Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management

A multi-modal reference implementation for traffic management, enabling partners to blend
camera and radar/lidar sensor inputs to accurately monitor traffic conditions.

## Overview

Metro AI Suite Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management is a reference implementation of an AI
system integrated with sensor fusion technology. It utilizes multi-modal sensors such as
cameras and radars/lidars to deliver traffic-management focused on performance, accuracy, and
reliability superseding those of camera-only solutions. Cameras capture high-resolution visual
data, while radar/lidar sensors precisely measure speed and distance, even under challenging
conditions such as fog, rain, or darkness. This integration ensures a more robust and
comprehensive approach to traffic monitoring and decision-making, enhancing overall system
performance and safety.

This sample features multiple pipelines tailored to specific sensor fusion use cases, combining
cameras with either radar or lidar:

- One camera paired with one mmWave radar (1C+1R),
- Four cameras paired with four mmWave radars (4C+4R),
- two cameras paired with one mmWave radar (2C+1R),
- sixteen cameras paired with four mmWave radars (16C+4R).
- Two cameras paired with one lidar (2C+1L),
- Four cameras paired with two lidars (4C+2L),
- Twelve cameras paired with two lidars (12C+2L),
- Eight cameras paired with four lidars (8C+4L),
- Twelve cameras paired with four lidars (12C+4L),
