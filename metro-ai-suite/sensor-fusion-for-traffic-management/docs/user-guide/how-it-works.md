# How It Works

This reference implementation enables the development of a high-performance, Intel-based® Intelligent Traffic Solution. The end-to-end pipeline of this software reference implementation includes the following major workloads, as shown in the following figure:

- Dataset loading and data format conversion
- Lidar signal processing
- Video analytics
- Data fusion
- Visualization


Each pipeline is deployed on a single Intel® SoC processor, providing the necessary heterogeneous compute capabilities from Intel Core™ processors and integrated GPU. The implementation includes video analytics optimized by the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit, radar/lidar signal processing accelerated by Intel® oneAPI, data fusion, and visualization. Key performance indicators, such as throughput and processing latency, significantly surpass current market standards. To maximize performance on Intel® processors, we optimized this SW RI using Intel software toolkits and open-source libraries.
