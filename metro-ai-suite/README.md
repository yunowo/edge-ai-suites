The **Metro AI Suite** accelerates application development for sophisticated edge AI video safety, security, and smart city use cases.

The Metro AI Suite includes Intel® software such as OpenVINO&trade; toolkit, Deep Learning Streamer, Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkit, and other tools, libraries, and microservices for media analytics and AI performance optimization for the abovementioned use cases.

It includes the following tools and tookits:
- [Metro AI Suite SDK](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-sdk-for-software-developers): Provides a comprehensive and modular toolkit for accelerated media processing and AI inference, designed to fast-track the development of visual AI solutions.
- [Visual Pipeline and Performance Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool): Assess Intel® hardware options, benchmark performance, and analyze key metrics to optimize hardware selection for AI workloads.
- [Device qualification tool](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-device-qualification-for-hardware-builder) For device and equipment manufacturers, the suite includes a device qualification tool to verify and benchmark hardware performance and create system qualification reports. See [recommended hardware catalog](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/edge-solutions/hardware.html) for a list of qualified system configurations.

The Suite also provides a collection of visual analytics sample applications, using deep learning and large models (generative AI):
